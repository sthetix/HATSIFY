## ⚙️ What It Does

HATSIFY modifies these configuration files on your SD card:
- `exosphere.ini` - Controls console identifier blanking
- `atmosphere/hosts/default.txt` - DNS blocking rules  
- `atmosphere/hosts/sysmmc.txt` - sysMMC-specific DNS rules
- `atmosphere/hosts/emummc.txt` - emuMMC-specific DNS rules
- `atmosphere/config/system_settings.ini` - DNS MITM settings

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

- **Understand the risks** before using online modes
- **Nintendo can detect** unauthorized modifications and ban consoles
- **Default mode is safest** - use it unless you specifically need online access
- **No warranty** - use at your own risk
- **Always backup** your original configuration files

## 🛡️ Safety Tips

- Start with **Default mode** for maximum protection
- Only use online modes if you **understand the consequences**
- **Clean installations** have lower ban risk than modded games
- **Don't use online modes** with pirated content
- **Monitor ban risk** discussions in homebrew communities
